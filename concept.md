###Basic Concept

There is an unprecedented amount of music available to the modern listener, and a plethora of algorithms that recommend music to people.  This website provides a platform where humans can help each other discover music (with alogorithms to aid them)

###Version 0.1 Specification:

1.) a user can "like" a track.  When this occurs, a card appears on the tracks newsfeed stating that a user liked a track.  

2.) The card has the track's name, album, and artist, a link to the track's page,  timestamp, and a link the user's profile. 

3.) the track page filters down all of the like events for that track.  

4.) the user's profile shows links to all of the songs that that user has liked.

###Later Versions:
-corresponding links to the artist page and the album page, which will be a lot like the track page.
-bootstrap and better look to UI
-graph assurances. e.g. uniqueness constaints.
-artist and album pages.
-ability to gracefully unlike a track.
-ability to comment on other people's like event.
